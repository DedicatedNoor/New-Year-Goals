                <p>It's important to acknowledge your failures and learn from them, but don't dwell on them or let them
                    define you. Instead, reflect on what went wrong and think about what you can do differently moving
                    forward. Use your failures as opportunities for growth and improvement. Remember, everyone fails at
                    some point, it's how you respond that matters.</p>
